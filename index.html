    <p><strong>David Viviano</strong>, <strong>Zerun Tian</strong>, <strong>Nikita Goyal</strong>, <strong>Kabir
        Dugal</strong></p>

    <p>Service-Learning Course Project as part of <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/ds4200-f19/">DS
        4200: Information Presentation and Visualization</a>, taught by <a
            href="https://cody.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Prof. Cody Dunne</a>, <a
            href="https://visualization.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Data Visualization @ Khoury</a>, <a
            href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>.</p>


    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p><em>The Chester Square Park Neighborhood Association has asked us to create a visualization that is focused on
        the pedestrians. They have noticed that
        pedestrians have opted to use the pathways that are closest to the main road, as opposed to the pathways that go
        through the park, due to reasons such as convenience, safety, etc. We were asked to
        emphasize this problem in our visualizations. We anticipate that the primary user of our visualization will be
        the Chester Square
        Neighborhood Association members. We also want it to be an entry point for more professional users, such as
        policy makers. Our visualization should be simple enough to gain local support but advanced enough to justify
        professional interest.</em></p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

    <p><em>
        Our visualization consists of three parts: a highlightable map of the Chester Square neighborhood, a parallel
        coordinates chart, and a table; all three are linked via the table, and are based off of data collected via
        observation
        and/or survey results. The primary result of our survey data is the parallel coordinates chart connected to the
        table below,
        showing the different answers provided by resident respondents to the survey. This was the chosen method to
        display this data
        because of simplicity of design and the way in which one could track each survey response and how each path they
        chose differed
        under different circumstances. One can interact with this by selecting a subset of the total values in a given
        column to
        see different responses to the survey at the same time and better track the choices of each respondent.
        Given the relatively small nature of the dataset, all the responses were presented in the table below the
        parallel coordinates
        chart. One can interact with this by clicking a row, representing a singular response, which then highlights the
        paths
        shown in that response on the adjacent map.

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em> We worked with 2 data sets to create the above visualizations - data from observations of pedestrians in
        Chester Square Park, and data from a survey sent to residents of the neighborhood. Our first data set is
        observation data that was collected by watching and recording the start locations, end locations, and the chosen
        path of pedestrians on-site. This data is meant to provide information on the travel tendencies of everyday
        commuters. Our second data set comes from a survey that we sent to the Chester Square Neighborhood Association,
        from which we received 14 responses. These results provide pathway preferences of residents under different
        circumstances.</em></p>

    <p><em>Our observation data contains the numbers 1-6, which corresponds to values on our map visualization. ‘Path
        Taken’ represents the pathway that the pedestrian took. The encoding, A-H, corresponds to the paths labeled on
        our map vis. The ‘To Destination’ column stores the values ‘N’ and ‘S’. ‘N’ means the pedestrian was travelling
        towards Northeastern, while ‘S’ means the pedestrian travelled towards Boston Medical Center. Finally, we
        recorded the date/time we collected data in the final column.
        For our survey data, each row represents a residents responses. The survey questions are the column headers: we
        kept track of what side of Massachusetts Avenue they live on, which paths they take in rush/non-rush situations,
        and which paths they would prefer to take in rush/non-rush situations.</em></p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>The above parallel coordinates visualization should be able to answer the following tasks: “Which pedestrian
        paths are used most and least?” and “Why does a pedestrian use a Chester Square sidewalk?”. It was created from
        survey data, highlighting resident’s preferences for paths in the neighborhood under different time constraints.
        When selecting a particular response/resident, that resident’s preferred paths will be highlighted in the
        parallel coordinates chart. In the map next to this, those paths will be highlighted, making it possible for the
        viewer to understand which paths are preferred while the resident is in a rush versus not in a rush, as well as
        most and least preferred path. The congestion of that path will be encoded in terms of line thickness, showing
        which routes are more popular using data from our data collection dataset. This is encoded in a map as to make
        it clear which path the pedestrian chose - if it is a more direct route or not. This visualization will
        highlight the reasons people use different paths as well as the overall most popular paths for residents and
        non-residents alike, in an attempt to more fully understand the pedestrian dynamic of Chester Square.</em></p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>

    <p><em>This final visualization is a product of many iterations of design. In trying to understand the ask of our
        stakeholder,
        the Chester Square Neighborhood Association, we were tasked with finding innovative ways to display the overall
        problem of
        pedestrian traffic. We created a number of preliminary ideas, some of which were then implemented. Below are the
        first sketches
        of potential visuals:
    </em></p>

    <img src="./images/map_sketch.png" width="300" height="200" alt="map sketch"/>

    <p><em>The final design we chose was a combination of the two main visuals; our group felt as if a map was necessary
        to understand the different spatial dynamics of the pedestrian project, while the parallel coordinates chart
        was a comprehendable chart, that was abstract enough to be visually appealing while displaying a wealth of
        information.
        Overall, the three main visuals in our final visualization all are linked and display information via brushing
        and linking
        so the user can get a holistic view of the problem at hand.
    </em></p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>We hope that our visualizations provide the Chester Square Park Neighborhood Association with the necessary
        information to begin their project on improving the experience of pedestrians using the neighborhood, as well as
        on improving
        the overall neighborhood attractiveness. We believe that they will be able to increase the efficiency of
        pedestrian
        traffic with ease, seeing as we made sure to emphasize the paths with the most/least congestion.
        In terms of future work, our team sees the visualization possibly encompassing real-time updates of pedestrian
        traffic. This would provide
        better insight into how congested the paths get at a specific time, on a specific day. We also see the potential
        to add more detail to the map,
        such that it better incorporates features of the park, and so that so that it is more visually pleasing to the
        user.</em></p>
