# Overview
This repository holds code for a website that creates multiple Data Visualizations on pedestrian traffic for the Chester Square neighborhood and the surrounding park area. The project was worked on by 4 team members for a 2 month course on Data Visualization and Presentation.  It included project analysis, data collection, visualization drafting, programming, and continued critique.

An overview, presentation, and video of the visualizations can be viewed here:  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ocxdsysISQHOV_pKoWwJDQX15YvoMTdk20JOyLoC6MQ/edit?usp=sharing

# Motivation
The Chester Square Park Neighborhood Association has asked us to create a visualization that is focused on the pedestrians. They have noticed that pedestrians have opted to use the pathways that are closest to the main road, as opposed to the pathways that go through the park, due to reasons such as convenience, safety, etc. We were asked to emphasize this problem in our visualizations. We anticipate that the primary user of our visualization will be the Chester Square Neighborhood Association members. We also want it to be an entry point for more professional users, such as policy makers. Our visualization should be simple enough to gain local support but advanced enough to justify professional interest
